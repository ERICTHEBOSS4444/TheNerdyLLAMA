<h3 style="color: yellow; text-align: center;">Hello! I bought Jeff The LLama at five below and I wanted to start a youtube channel for quite some time, however there is a big problem with this. youtube has many copyright standards that are becoming absurd and I didn't want to handle their problems so I had my brother start a webpage once he got the ability to. Ive always wanted to own a comic book company and a movie studio so I can be creative and people can see my creations.</h3>
